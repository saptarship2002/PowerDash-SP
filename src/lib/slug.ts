/** Plain-ASCII, hyphenated identifier for a state name, used in the /state/[name] URL instead of
 * the raw name. Every state name here is just letters and spaces, so this is lossless and
 * type-independent — no encoding is ever needed for the URL segment itself, which sidesteps a
 * `next dev` + `output: export` bug where the dev server matches the raw (percent-encoded)
 * request path against a static param's un-encoded, delimiter-escaped pathname (they can never be
 * equal whenever the segment contains a space) — see generateStaticParams in
 * app/state/[name]/page.tsx. */
